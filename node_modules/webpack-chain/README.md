Use a chaining API to generate and simplify the modification of
webpack version 2-4 configurations.

This documentation corresponds to v6 of webpack-chain. For previous versions, see:

* [v5 docs](https://github.com/neutrinojs/webpack-chain/tree/v5)
* [v4 docs](https://github.com/neutrinojs/webpack-chain/tree/v4)
* [v3 docs](https://github.com/neutrinojs/webpack-chain/tree/v3)
* [v2 docs](https://github.com/neutrinojs/webpack-chain/tree/v2)
* [v1 docs](https://github.com/neutrinojs/webpack-chain/tree/v1)

_Note: while webpack-chain is utilized extensively in Neutrino, this package is
completely standalone and can be used by any project._

## Introduction

webpack's core configuration is based on creating and modifying a
potentially unwieldy JavaScript object. While this is OK for configurations
on individual projects, trying to share these objects across projects and
make subsequent modifications gets messy, as you need to have a deep
understanding of the underlying object structure to make those changes.

`webpack-chain` attempts to improve this process by providing a chainable or
fluent API for creating and modifying webpack configurations. Key portions
of the API can be referenced by user-specified names, which helps to
standardize how to modify a configuration across projects.

This is easier explained through the examples following.

## Installation

`webpack-chain` requires Node.js v6.9 and higher. `webpack-chain` also
only creates configuration objects designed for use in webpack versions 2, 3,
and 4.

You may install this package using either Yarn or npm (choose one):

**Yarn**

```bash
yarn add --dev webpack-chain
```

**npm**

```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack-chain
```

## Getting Started

Once you have `webpack-chain` installed, you can start creating a
webpack configuration. For this guide, our example base configuration will
be `webpack.config.js` in the root of our project directory.

```js
// Require the webpack-chain module. This module exports a single
// constructor function for creating a configuration API.
const Config = require('webpack-chain');

// Instantiate the configuration with a new API
const config = new Config();

// Make configuration changes using the chain API.
// Every API call tracks a change to the stored configuration.

config
  // Interact with entry points
  .entry('index')
    .add('src/index.js')
    .end()
  // Modify output settings
  .output
    .path('dist')
    .filename('[name].bundle.js');

// Create named rules which can be modified later
config.module
  .rule('lint')
    .test(/\.js$/)
    .pre()
    .include
      .add('src')
      .end()
    // Even create named uses (loaders)
    .use('eslint')
      .loader('eslint-loader')
      .options(
